issues to fix:

1. extract_ms.py

Sometimes the adjective retained, but noun goes missing
causes issues in IIRU task

eg: Dan has 32 green and 38 violet marbles. Mike took 23 of Dan’s green marbles. How many green marbles does Dan now have?

ms: [' how many green marbles does dan now have?',' dan has 32 green ', 'dan has  and 38 violet marbles ', ' mike took 23 of dan’s green marbles']

the second item in the list has 'marbles' missing, causing issues in IIRU task

possible fix:
consider the noun following the adj and include it

2. IIRU.py

while extracting adjectives and nouns, in extract_nouns_adj_cd
unnecessary adj like the "many" in "how many?" gets included, causing issues in IIRU

fix: consider ONLY those adj that precede nouns

3. Microstatements

"Dan has 32 green and 38 violet marbles. Mike took 23 of Dan's green marbles. How many green marbles does Dan now have?"

[' how many green marbles does dan now have ?',' dan has 32 green ', 'dan has  38 violet marbles ', ' mike took 23 of dan ', 'mike took  s green marbles ']}

problem: gets confused cus of the apostrophe in "Dan's"

4. IIRU

mwp_multiplication = 'There are 9 boxes. There are 2 pencils in each box. How many pencils are there in all boxes?'

unable to consider box and boxes as same entity.
MS: ['there are 9 boxes ', ' there are 2 pencils in each box ', ' how many pencils are there in all boxes ?']
KB sets are:
Knowledge Base for QUESTION:
{1: {'boxes', 'pencils'}}

Knowledge Base for WORLD:
1 {'boxes'}
2 {'box', 'pencils'}
{1: '9', 2: '2'}

Shoudld be box instead of boxes
